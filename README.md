# Jocopa : Powered by Rails, AngularJS, Bootstrap

This repo, codenamed 'Jocopa', is an exciting new pet project that I've recently taken on. In short, it aims to become a user-focused platform dedicated to creating jobs for individuals in Nortern Ontario. 

The back-end is mainly being developed utilizing Ruby on Rails and Postgres, while the front-end boasts HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS and Bootstrap technologies. 

Thanks for checking out my work!
